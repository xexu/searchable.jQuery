Searchable

It's a simple jQuery plugin that enables an input to filter an ```<ul>``` list.
It shows/hides items that match/don't match the query on the input. Check the demo.

Usage
-----
Just set the data-searchable-target attribute or use the option search_target when you make an input searchable to set the target (an ```<ul>``` tag)
